# Sudoku

Let's build [Sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku).  If you don't know Sudoku, that's ok!   This project can go in one of two directions:

1. Allow users to play Sudoku
1. Write a program that solves Sudoku puzzles

## Sample Puzzles

Here are some sample puzzles you can start with. The `0`'s represent empty cells.

## Iterations

## v0.1 - The Board

Represent the Sudoku board in code and allow cells to be filled in.  The board should know if a given number is permitted in a particular cell.

You should also have a function that can print a board.

## Direction 1 - Playable Sudoku

Allow users to load a Sudoku puzzle and solve it.  Users will need to:

- Choose a number and a cell to put that number into
- Remove a number from a particular cell (but not one of the initial numbers)
- Know when they've made an illegal move
- Know when there's a cell that can't be filled (because every other number is accounted for)

## Direction 2 - Sudoku Solver

This direction is much harder, but also fun!  It's ok to look up approaches for solving this and implementing them yourself, but remember that your code should still be clean and well-tested.

[Backtracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking) is a commonly-used technique, but you will have to be careful in your implementation.
